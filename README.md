# Weather-Forecasting-Logistic-Regression
The project's goal is to analyze weather data to predict rain for the following day. It starts with data collection and preprocessing to manage missing values, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between weather attributes and the target variable, 'RainTomorrow'.

Next, the project builds a regression model to predict precipitation levels, selecting relevant features and using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy scores and confusion matrices, with grid search for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to ensure robustness. Various evaluation metrics, including R-squared, mean absolute error, and ROC AUC score, are calculated.

In the end, the project concludes by assessing the effectiveness of different classification algorithms, identifying the best models for practical weather forecasting applications.
